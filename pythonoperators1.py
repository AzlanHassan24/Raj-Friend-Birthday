#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper.
#Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

#storing values 
tree1 = 67
tree2 = 36
tree3 = 69
tree4 = 71
tree5 = 29

#finding the sum of trees
sum = tree1+tree2+tree3+tree4+tree5

print("The sum of all the 5 trees in jack's front yard is:", sum)

#finding the average height of the trees
average = sum/5
print("The average of all the trees is :", average )
